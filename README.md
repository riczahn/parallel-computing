# Parallel Computing
This repository is a collection of solutions to the same problem using different technologies. It is the result of former assignments from the TDT4200 course at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in which a serial solution had to be turned into a parallel solution. The parallelisation was done with the **Message Passing Interface (MPI)**, **OpenMP**, **Pthreads** and **CUDA**.

## Shallow Water Equations
The shallow-water equations describe a thin layer of fluid where we can
consider the density to be constant and in hydrostatic balance. The system is
bounded from below by the bottom topography and from above by a free
surface. One application of the shallow water equations is that they can
describe the propagation of a tsunami accurately until the wave approaches
the shore. Near the shore, a more complicated model is required. Similarly, it
can also model mud slides and splashes in a tub.

## Project Structure
The repository contains a folder for each solution. Each sub-project is fully independent and can be opened on its own. Read the README of the technology of interest for more information.

**The code was written in 2022**
